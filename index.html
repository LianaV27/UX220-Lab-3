        <h2>No Longer Impossible</h2>
        <p> The best movie I saw recently was Mission: Impossible â€“ Dead Reckoning Part One. My family decided to go see
            it in theatres one night on a whim.
            I had always been a Mission: Impossible fan, but it had been a while since I had seen one of the movies and
            I had worried that the quality
            of the series had dropped, given that this is the seventh film in the series. I was pleasantly and
            completely surprised by this film.
            <br><br>
            The movie's plot is tight and fascinating, with the main character, a charming agent working with his
            friends to recover both halves of a key
            to a powerful AI system to destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands. Different factions compete for
            the pieces of the key, hindering the protagonists.
            The AI itself messes with the heroes, erasing the antagonist's movements from the security feed they had
            hacked into and fabricating his image in other locations.
            The AI also hacks into their communication systems, falsifying the voice of one of the protagonist's friends
            to feed him incorrect information. The AI and the
            human antagonists feel powerful and deadly, adding a sense of weight and urgency to the film. The film's
            exploration of AI as an antagonistic force really caught
            my attention, and is especially notable considering the recent progress of AI development and the
            integration of it into everyday lives.
            <br><br>
            The acting is solid and the characters are as likable and/or fearsome as usual. Ethan Hunt is a charismatic
            protagonist who is always fun to watch navigate
            increasingly difficult and dangerous scenarios with ridiculously improbable odds. I also enjoyed the
            friendship between the main three heroes, who often banter
            and are willing to lay down their lives for each other. I am also a fan of the newest addition, a sly and
            selfish thief who is introduced by tricking the hero.
            The actions scenes are also fantastic as the film heavily features real stunts and locations. I am really
            excited to see the conclusion to this story and plan
            to go to see it in theatres as soon as it comes out. I can only hope that the second part of it is as good
            as the first, but with how much skill went into this
            one, my hopes are high.
